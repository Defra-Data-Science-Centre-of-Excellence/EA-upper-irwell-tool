    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "This workbook is a unified workflow that combines the data and functionalities of four existing EA owned tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tNFM Opportunities Map (by JBA Consultants): Identifies areas capable of storing different water volumes and lists potential features for flood mitigation.\n",
    "2.\tNFM Storage Tool (by Jacobs): Analyzes how varying storage volumes affect flood hydrographs, return periods, and properties at risk.\n",
    "3.\tEA Property reports for all the communities at risk from the NW Opportunities Map/Toolkit (Jacobs) identifies numbers of properties at risk by risk band and deprivation, and weighted annual average damages. Also has lots of natural capital information. This is a GMMC only held data set.\n",
    "4.\tDEFRA Funding Calculator: Calculates potential funding released by DEFRA for flood mitigation schemes based on changes in property risk levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this workbook is solely trying to make the best use of exisitng data and information. It should only be used as a scoping tool rather than as a detailed planning tool. Many assumptions and approximations are made throughout this workbook to be able to make this workflow. These are highlighted throughout the workbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this workbook\n",
    "The Upper Irwell Investment tool consists of python code presented in a jupyter workbook, and a folder of data files associated with it. Rather than hiding the code away behind a user interface, it is presented here so that tool can be easily developed in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the master copy of the code and no one can edit it, so don't worry about making mistakes. To edit this document you must click file -> save a copy in drive and then edit that document instead. (you will need a google account to do this)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uploading the data\n",
    "Go to the sharepoint site and download the folder 'Irwell_Tool_Data'. This contains all of the files you need to run the workbook. If this has downloaded as a zip file, make sure you unzip it to be able to access all of the files inside. Now go back to the google workbook and click on the folder symbol to the left of this text in colab. A sidebar should appear. Either drag and drop all of the files into the sidebar, or click the upload file symbol at the top and navigate to the files to upload. Some of the files are quite large, so make sure they have all uploaded properly before you run the workbook. You can see the progress of the uploads with a loading circle in the sidebar. Colab does not save this data, so you will need to upload it every session. Remeber to upload data to the main folder NOT the sample data folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading the Results\n",
    "Results are stored in a folder called 'Results'. Make sure that you download files and save them to you own computer as they will be deleted from the colab storage when you close the workbook (or if you let the session expire). Navigate to the files you want to download then click the 3 dots next to the file and selevt download. Find the files you downloaded and rename/move them in accordance with your own naming conventions and file system. I have included the time and date that the file was created in the file name so that none of your results are overwritten. You need to rename them so they make sense to you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is python code?\n",
    "Do not be intimidated by the code!! Coding is just writing instructions in the correct language (python) and instructing the installed interpreter (python) to run the program on your computer. Rather than having to install python onto your computer, we will be working in google colab to avoid any intallation issues. Colab is basically letting us run python code on their servers in the cloud rather than running python on our own machine. This is why we need to upload any data that we want python to look at to the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are working in what is known as a 'Jupyter notebook' which lets us develop our code in a very interactive way, allowing us to have text, images, figures and code all in one place. You will see alternating text blocks and code blocks throughout this notebook. When code blocks are executed, graphs, text or data tables may be outputted beneath them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we are just writing instructions and getting a computer to interpret them. There are very few lines of code that you need to change in this workbook and they will be clearly marked with comments in the code. A python comment looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This is what a comment looks like. Anything that follows a hash symbol is ignored by python, so we can write human readable instructions directly into code blocks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the code\n",
    "Once you have made your changes to the code and have uploaded the associated dataset, you can execute the whole workbook by going to 'Runtime -> Run all' at the top of the page. This will run all of the code cells in the workbook. Note that 'optimisation' cells towards the end of the notebook may take a very long time (hours) to run. You may therefore wish to execute single cells of code instead. You can do so by pressing the 'play' button at the top left of a code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Python works by running instructions in order. In the code we create data objects and variables that are held in the computer's memory. If we run a code cell again with different values, the variables will be overwritten in the memory of the computer with these new values. So if you start running cells out of order, then you may get some confusing results or some errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors\n",
    "When python can't understand something, it will create an error message beneath the code cell. These errors can be quite hard to interpret, even if you are familiar with python. Given how few lines of code there are to edit, it is unlikely that you will get any errors. The most likely ones that you will come across will because:\n",
    "- The data files have not uploaded correctly. Some of the files are big and if there is any disruption to the upload then they may be only partially there. Try again!\n",
    "- Typos. Code is VERY strict about characters, spaces, capitilization and punctuation. Check that everything is typed correctly then try again!\n",
    "- Searching for something that doesn't exist. It may be that a catchment or community that we thought was captured in the data isn't. You can check this by looking in the uploaded data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an AI function in colab that will help you understand the errors better. Alternatively, copy and paste your error into google and look for similar problems on Stack Overflow. This is exactly what professional programmers do!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel like you've broken the code beyond repair, you can always start over and make a new copy of this master version! Or email elizabeth.lewis-3@manchester.ac.uk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning to code\n",

    "# 4. Reading in the JACOBS storage tool data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobs NFM storage tool was developed to assess how much NFM storage is needed to reduce flood peaks in communities at risk. The tool uses the standard UK method for estimating flood flows (the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH)) at 571 communities at Flood risk in the GMMC area. The tool calculates the volume of water that would be required to be stored upstream, to avoid flooding the downstream community at risk at different return period flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "The underpinning dataset (Calculated_Hydrographs.csv) contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Unique_id': Specific flow location just upstream of a community\n",
    "- 'SoP': standard of protection: indication of the lowest threshold of the risk for that community. Mising values == natural water courses, RP5 is default\n",
    "- 'RP': the RP for a given scenario\n",
    "- 'volume': proportion of hydrograph above the SoP threshold line, per timestep\n",
    "- 'QT': Flow at a specified timestep in the design even. measure in cubic meters per second\n",
    "- 'Flow': peak flow for a given RP\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions relating to the use of the Jacobs tool\n",
    "- FEH method provides useful design hydrographs representative of the assigned return period.\n",
    "- A baseline standard of protection of RP5.\n",
    "- The properties at risk are at risk from river flooding based on the equivalent return period design storm from FEH.\n",
    "- Communities at risk that are situated at the confluence of two rivers combine the design hydrographs of both branches into a single set of hydrographs for use in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing in this section should be changed. Similar to section 1, the code in this section only needs to be run once per session to read in the JACOBS storage data data. Reading data into memory is relatively slow, so it's better to avoid reading everything in again if you don't have to. The JACOBS dataset is the largest file that has to be read into this workbook. I have therefore created a faster-to-load version of the file called 'Calculated_Hydrographs.p' which won't be human readable. If for some reason the JACOBS stoarage dataset 'Calculated_Hydrographs.csv' is ever changed, you can recreate this .p file by running the second code block below. To run it, first remove the triple quote marks at the start and end of the code. Create the .p file and download it manually from the files sidebar. Replace the original .p file in the files to upload folder and use that in the future . Replace the triple quotes when you are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communities at Risk\n",
    "See below for the table of communities at risk and which design storm IDs are associated with them. If there are two IDs this means that the CaR sits at the confluence of two rivers.\n"

    "\n",
    "In this section we define a function the combines all of the datasets together to find GIA and benefit/cost ratios for the catchments from the Defra funding calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DEFRA calculator is coded up as a seperate python module and imported as 'calculator'\n",
    "\n",
    "This function uses the following method:\n",
    "- Finds information related to the community of risk\n",
    "- calculates the %area of the water body that is associated with the community at risk catchment\n",
    "- Calculates the maximum potential NFM that could benefit that community\n",
    "- Calculates the design floods for that community from the JACOBS data\n",
    "- Calculates how much water needs to be stored to reduce the flood risk between categories\n",
    "- Compares that volume to the maximum storage available\n",
    "- Moves properties between flood risk categories according to the maximum reduction in flood risk available\n",
    "- Calculates the Grant in Aid (GIA) available using the DEFRA calculator and returns other metrics of interest such as the Benefit Cost Ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "- Flood risk in a community can be well described by the FEH design event\n",
    "- NFM storage available is proportional to the fraction of the water body that the community's catchment area occupies.\n",
    "- No sliding scale of changing flood risk, either all properties move flood risk category or they don't.\n",
